Hourglass?
  Given a  2D Array, :

  1 1 1 0 0 0
  0 1 0 0 0 0
  1 1 1 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0
  An hourglass in  is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:
    a b c
      d
    e f g
  There are 16 hourglasses in arr[6][6]. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in, then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6x6.

Complete the function hourglassSum.
  hourglassSum has the following parameter(s):
    int arr[6][6]: an array of integers
  Returns:
    int: the maximum hourglass sum
